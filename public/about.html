      <p class="basic">Hnefatafl is a anchent Vikings Game that has been dated back to around 750ad. 
         Henefatal quickly rose to popularity.  The game was taken by the Norse setters to many different locations.  
         Some example of where the game was play are: Greenland, Iceland and the British Isles and many others.  
         Once European chess came to Great Britten, the once popular Hnefatafl was no longer played and lost its popularity.  
         It was not till recently when historians started to piece together the rules and game play from ancient writings they have found to make the game as accurate and close to how the Vikings played centuries ago.
