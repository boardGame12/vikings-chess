  <div class="aboutRuth">
    <p>My name is Ruth Ann Aakre and I was one of the group members that worked on Hnefatafl.  This has been one of my favorite projects I have been apart of.  I love both game design and web development.  It has been exciting to take an ancient game and make it virtual where you and your friends can play against each other and make memories together.  Please let us know if there are any edits or future updates you would like to see.  Have fun playing and chatting with your friends on this game.  If you would like to know more about me my linkin is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-aakre-8a277b272/" target="_blank">here</a> and my personal website is <a href="http://aakreruth.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Have a wonderful day and have fun gaming.</p>
